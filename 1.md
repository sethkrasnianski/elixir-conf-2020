# Welcome to Alpine
- Alpine is a thin JavaScript API for easily creating reactive LiveView interfaces
- Alpine works cohesively with LiveView
- x-directives to bind alpine to elements
- Directives are very similar to angular
- 14 directives so the API is relatively lightweight
- Alpine runs after LiveView updates so there’s no requirement for things like phx-update=“ignore”
- jQuery for LiveView

## LiveView Hooks

### There are some life-cycle callbacks which are invoked in response to the change in a LiveView:

`mounted` - the element has been added to the DOM and its server LiveView has finished mounting

`beforeUpdate` - the element is about to be updated in the DOM. Note: any call here must be synchronous as the operation cannot be deferred or cancelled.

`updated` - the element has been updated in the DOM by the server

`beforeDestroy` - the element is about to be removed from the DOM. Note: any call here must be synchronous as the operation cannot be deferred or cancelled.

`destroyed` - the element has been removed from the page, either by a parent update, or by the parent being removed entirely

`disconnected` - the element's parent LiveView has disconnected from the server

`reconnected` - the element's parent LiveView has reconnected to the server

### Those life-cycle callbacks have in-scope access to the following attributes:
`el` - attribute referencing the bound DOM node

`viewName` - attribute matching the DOM node's phx-view value

`pushEvent(event, payload, (reply, ref) => ...)` - method to push an event from the client to the LiveView server

`pushEventTo(selectorOrTarget, event, payload, (reply, ref) => ...)` - method to push targeted events from the client to LiveViews and LiveComponents.

`handleEvent(event, (payload) => ...)` - method to handle an event pushed from the server
