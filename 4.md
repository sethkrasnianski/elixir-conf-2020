# Alpine is alright
- If you have the requirement for mildly complicated UI interactions then it's a good choice
- Alpine still might be a good candidate for relaly complicated requirements but the talk didn't highlight them
- Directives will feel very similar to anyone already familiar with LiveView directives
- Seems good for small teams or teams where proficiency is in Elixir
- Probably not a good solution if you have dedicated front and back end teams
