# Alpine is alright
- If you have the requirement for mildly complicated UI interactions then it's a good choice
- Alpine still might be a good candidate for relaly complicated requirements but the talk didn't highlight them
- With enough structure you could potentially emulate a react client without much Alpine.js code at all
- Seems good for small teams or teams where proficiency is in Elixir
- Probably not a good solution if you have dedicated front and back end teams
